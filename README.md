# Front-end code for a To-do app

### This is the front-end part for a To-do app. It is created to work with back-end located [here](https://github.com/Dominykas-Zernys/todo-app-back-end).

In this application you can register as a new user and login into your account. Only registered and logged in users can add new to-dos and delete already existing ones. Every user can only see his own created to-dos.

In order to launch this front-end part of the application:

1. Clone the master branch of this repository;
2. Install the node modules by executing 'npm install' command in your bash terminal;
3. Change the '.env.example' file name into '.env' and insert the proper value instead of the angle brackets and text inside them;
4. Launch the server by executing 'npm start' command in the bash terminal.
